# strawburn_alerts
Weekly alerts for rice straw burning based on calibrated RiceBurnedIndex. The Rice Burned Index (RBI) blends the burn signal and the cleaned-up greenness. Areas with higher RBI are more likely to be recently burned rice fields; lower RBI looks more like healthy, unburned crops.

User can draw the AOI interactively. Please test in hotspot of rice straw burning e.g. (1) Sta. Rosa Nueva Ecija; (2) Palo, Leyte (3) Bay, Laguna
